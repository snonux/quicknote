# Working on TurboNotes

TurboNotes is a Flutter app (Android primary, Linux desktop for development)
that edits every Markdown file in one configured notes folder. It is a sibling
of snonux/quicklog and shares its toolchain, signing and release conventions,
but has no S3 or any other network code: the Android release manifest has no
`INTERNET` permission, and nothing should add one.

Before calling anything done: `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` must both be
clean. For anything touching the Android build, build a release APK too --
`flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi` -- because the debug build hides
signing and packaging problems. CI does all three plus a Linux release build.

Toolchain: JDK **17 or 21** only. Gradle 8.14 rejects JDK 25 outright.

## Layout

- `lib/services/note_store.dart` -- the `NoteStore` interface. Notes are
  addressed by relative POSIX paths (`projects/todo.md`), validated by
  `normalizeNotePath`. Two implementations: `DirectoryNoteStore` (dart:io,
  atomic writes) and `SafNoteStore` (Android document tree via the
  `org.buetow.turbonotes/saf-notes` channel, implemented in
  `android/.../SafNotes.kt`). Keep their behaviour identical: same filtering
  (`.md`/`.markdown`, no dot-folders), `create` and `rename` never overwrite.
- `lib/editor/` -- the WYSIWYG editor. `MarkdownStyler` paints the Markdown
  source; it must emit exactly one character per source character (a few are
  substituted 1:1, like `-` -> `•`), or the caret and selection drift. The
  test `emits exactly one character per source character` guards that. Never
  replace this with a converter to another document model: a lossy round trip
  silently reformats people's notes. An inline image off the active line
  hides its source and turns the closing `)` into the `WidgetSpan`
  placeholder, so the count still adds up. The WYSIWYG field needs
  `strutStyle: StrutStyle.disabled`: the default forced strut keeps lines
  from growing around images. Decoded images live in `AttachmentCache`
  (`lib/widgets/note_image.dart`), which relayouts the editor once one loads.
- `lib/editor/vi_engine.dart` -- vi's modal editing (Preferences: Vi keys,
  Linux only, since normal mode needs key events an on-screen keyboard does
  not send). A pure engine on the text controller, tested in
  `test/vi_engine_test.dart`; `NoteEditor` feeds it keys from its
  `FocusNode.onKeyEvent` and makes the field `readOnly` outside insert mode,
  so a command key can never type. The sidebar's own vi keys live in
  `NoteTreeView` and are always on.
- `lib/services/fuzzy.dart` -- the fuzzy matcher behind the finder.
- `lib/services/note_index.dart`, `text_search.dart`, `tags.dart` -- the
  in-memory text index of all notes behind full-text search (typo tolerant)
  and the `#tag` tree. `HomeScreen` keeps the index current through the
  editor's `onSaved`.
- `lib/services/note_export.dart` -- renders a note offscreen (its own
  `PipelineOwner`/`BuildOwner`; GlobalKeys do not work there) to one PNG or
  to an A4 PDF of page images, written by hand with `dart:io`'s zlib.
  `share_service.dart` hands the result to the Android share sheet, or to the
  clipboard and Downloads on Linux.
- Platform channels besides SAF: `org.buetow.turbonotes/clipboard` (image
  paste; `MainActivity.kt` and `linux/runner/clipboard_channel.cc`),
  `org.buetow.turbonotes/images` (gallery pick and camera, Android only;
  `MainActivity.kt` and `DeviceImages.kt`; the camera writes into a
  `ShareProvider` capture file, so no camera permission is needed) and
  `org.buetow.turbonotes/share` (`MainActivity.kt`, files served by
  `ShareProvider.kt`).
- Android quick capture is native Kotlin, not Flutter, so it opens without
  starting the engine: `CaptureWidget.kt` (home-screen widget) and
  `CaptureActivity.kt` (the dialog, also the share target) append through
  `DefaultNote.kt`, which reads the Flutter preferences
  (`flutter.ScopedTreeUri`, `flutter.Directory`, `flutter.DefaultNote`).
  Keep those keys in sync with `lib/services/preferences.dart`.
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` -- tree plus editor side by side at 760 px
  and wider; narrower, a note opens on its own `NotePage`. Note dialogs
  (path prompt, delete confirmation) live in `lib/widgets/note_dialogs.dart`,
  snackbars and user-facing error text in `lib/widgets/feedback.dart`.
- `lib/widgets/note_editor.dart` -- saves on its own: `saveBeforeLeave()`
  before anything closes the note, and a quiet save when the app goes to the
  background or its window closes. That background save must never overwrite
  a note changed on disk (Syncthing); it writes a conflict copy instead
  (`conflictCopyPath`). Interactive saves ask in the "Changed on disk" dialog.
- User docs: `README.md` (kept short; install points to F-Droid),
  `docs/usage.md` and `docs/install.md`, screenshots in `docs/images/`.
  Screenshots are phone shots only (`phone-*.png`, 400x760), plus tablet
  shots (`tablet-*.png`, 1280x800) only where the wide layout differs; no
  desktop shots except `linux-vi.png` (1280x800), for the Linux-only vi
  keys. Update the docs and shots when the UI changes.

## Releasing

The steps for a new release are in [docs/release.md](docs/release.md). What
must not break in the build:

- The `applicationVariants` block at the bottom of
  `android/app/build.gradle.kts` sets the per-ABI version codes,
  `counter * 10 + abi` (1 armeabi-v7a, 2 arm64-v8a, 3 x86_64). Do not drop it.
- Never remove the `dependenciesInfo` block from that file: F-Droid's scanner
  rejects the Google Play dependency-metadata signing block.
- Release builds are path-sensitive if they are ever to be reproducible on
  F-Droid: build from `/tmp/build` against an SDK at `/opt/android-sdk`, as
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` does.
- Without the git-ignored `android/key.properties`, a local release build
  falls back to the debug keys and says so.

## Testing gotchas

**No `dart:io` directly in a `testWidgets` body.** The body runs on a fake
clock where those futures never complete, and the test hangs. Widget tests use
`test/support/memory_note_store.dart`; filesystem tests are plain `test()`s
(`test/note_store_test.dart`).

**`pumpAndSettle` times out while a save is pending**: the Save button shows a
spinner, which never settles. Pump a fixed duration instead.
